# Technical Interview Algorithm Practice

This repository contains my ongoing training for technical interviews, focused on algorithmic thinking, Python problem-solving, and coding efficiency.

The goal is to strengthen my ability to solve problems under constraints — time pressure, limited tools, and no external help — replicating real interview conditions.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- basics/ → Fundamental exercises (strings, arrays, loops, conditionals)
- intermediate/ → Problems requiring data structures and multi-step logic
- advanced/ → Complex problems involving recursion, optimization, or custom algorithms
- random_challenge/ → Script that generates 3 random exercises (basic, intermediate, advanced)

<br>

## 🎯 Training Strategy

1. **Day A – Learning New Problems (Hackerrank / LeetCode style)**
   - Study 1–3 new exercises.
   - Write a clean, well-documented solution in Python.
   - Add comments explaining:
     - core logic
     - edge cases
     - time & space complexity

<br>

2. **Day B – Random Challenge (Interview Simulation)**
   - Run the `generator.py` script.
   - Solve 3 random problems:
     - 1 basic  
     - 1 intermediate  
     - 1 advanced  
   - No external help (AI, internet, notes).
   - Timer on → real interview pressure.
   - Document results if needed.

## 🧪 Random Challenge Script

Located in: ```random_challenge/generator.py```

automatically selects one random exercise from each difficulty level.
This helps create unpredictable and realistic interview practice sessions.

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

Technical interviews require:
- algorithmic fluency 
- strong reasoning skills  
- performance under pressure  
- clean code and clear logic

This repository is my structured approach to developing those skills over time.
I will continuously update it as I prepare for future opportunities.
